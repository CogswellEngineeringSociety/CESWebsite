# Changing Structure and Moving
The code will be changed to fit react-redux framework. The pages for forums, 3DPrinting, and renting books / tutorials will be their own apps, accessed through subdomains. As such, each of them will be in their own repository.
# CESWebsite
Website for the club. The website will have news section, feedback, and page to upload models for 3DPrinting.
